## What Is This?

An open-source MCP Server (installed via plugin marketplace) that gives LLMs creative and aesthetic capabilities through 7 tools and carefully designed skills, enabling them to handle complex design tasks. It teaches LLMs how to use various image generation models effectively, delivering professional results through reference images and multi-direction parallel workflows.

- Works with local ComfyUI — no external API dependency; also easily integrates with any custom API
- Built-in 1,500+ curated prompt templates from [nanobanana-trending-prompts](https://github.com/jau123/nanobanana-trending-prompts) and fine-tuned prompt engineering techniques that turn requirements into concrete image generation tasks
- Parallel batch generation and sub-agent execution to keep the main context window clean

### Product Photo — 4 Directions in Parallel

> *"Create 4 product display images for this perfume, one of which should feature a model."*

**Process** — AI uploads the reference image, crafts 4 distinct prompts, then generates all 4 in parallel:

## Quick Start

### Claude Code Plugin (Recommended)

```bash
# Add the plugin marketplace
/plugin marketplace add jau123/MeiGen-AI-Design-MCP

# Install
/plugin install meigen@meigen-marketplace
```

**Restart Claude Code** after installation (close and reopen, or open a new terminal tab).

**Alternative marketplace** — also available via [wshobson/agents](https://github.com/wshobson/agents) (30k+ stars):

```bash
/plugin marketplace add wshobson/agents
/plugin install meigen-ai-design@claude-code-workflows
```

> This marketplace doesn't bundle MCP server config. After installing, add to your project's `.mcp.json`:
> ```json
> { "mcpServers": { "meigen": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "meigen@1.2.7"] } } }
> ```

#### First-Time Setup

Free features work immediately after restart — try:

> "Search for some creative inspiration"

To unlock image generation, run the setup wizard:

```
/meigen:setup
```

The wizard walks you through:
1. **Choose a provider** — local ComfyUI, MeiGen Cloud, or any OpenAI-compatible API (bring your own key & endpoint)
2. **Enter credentials** — ComfyUI URL, API token, or key
3. **Done** — restart Claude Code once more, then start generating

### Cursor / VS Code / Windsurf / Roo Code

One command to set up MeiGen for any supported AI coding tool:

```bash
npx meigen init cursor      # Cursor
npx meigen init vscode      # VS Code / GitHub Copilot
npx meigen init windsurf    # Windsurf
npx meigen init roo         # Roo Code
npx meigen init claude      # Claude Code (project-level)
```

This writes the correct MCP config file with the right format and path for your tool. If a config file already exists, MeiGen is merged in without overwriting your other servers.

### OpenClaw

Install the full plugin from [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/plugins/meigen-ai-design) (includes commands, skills, and MCP server):

```bash
openclaw bundles install clawhub:meigen-ai-design
```

Or install only the skill (no commands/agents):

```bash
npx clawhub@latest install creative-toolkit
```

### Other MCP-Compatible Hosts

Add to your MCP config (e.g. `.mcp.json`, `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "meigen": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "meigen@latest"],
      "env": {
        "MEIGEN_API_TOKEN": "meigen_sk_..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Free features (inspiration search, prompt enhancement, model listing) work without any API key.

| `/meigen:models` | Browse and switch AI models for this session |
| `/meigen:setup` | Interactive provider configuration wizard |

### Smart Agents

MeiGen uses specialized sub-agents for efficient parallel execution:

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `image-generator` | Executes `generate_image` in isolated context — enables true parallel generation |
| `prompt-crafter` | Writes multiple distinct prompts for batch generation (runs on Haiku for cost efficiency) |
| `gallery-researcher` | Deep gallery exploration without cluttering the main conversation (runs on Haiku) |

### Output Styles

Switch creative modes with `/output-style`:

- **Creative Director** — Art direction mode with visual storytelling, mood boards, and design thinking
- **Minimal** — Just images and file paths, no commentary. Ideal for batch workflows

### Automation Hooks

- **Config Check** — Validates provider configuration on session start, guides setup if missing
- **Auto-Open** — Generated images automatically open in Preview (macOS)

---

<h2 id="providers">Providers</h2>

MeiGen MCP supports three image generation backends. Configure one or multiple — the system auto-selects the best available.

### ComfyUI — Local & Free

Run generation on your own GPU with full control over models, samplers, and workflow parameters. Import any ComfyUI API-format workflow — MeiGen auto-detects KSampler, CLIPTextEncode, EmptyLatentImage, and LoadImage nodes.

```json
{
  "comfyuiUrl": "http://localhost:8188",
  "comfyuiDefaultWorkflow": "txt2img"
}
```

> Perfect for Flux, SDXL, or any model you run locally. Your images never leave your machine.

### MeiGen Cloud

Cloud API with multiple models: Nanobanana 2, Seedream 5.0, GPT image 1.5, and more. No GPU required.

**Get your API token:**
1. Sign in at [meigen.ai](https://www.meigen.ai)
2. Click your avatar → **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Create a new key (starts with `meigen_sk_`)

```json
{ "meigenApiToken": "meigen_sk_..." }
```

### Bring Your Own API (OpenAI-Compatible)

Connect **any** image generation API that follows the OpenAI format — Together AI, Fireworks AI, DeepInfra, SiliconFlow, or your own endpoint. Just provide your key, base URL, and model name:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "sk-...",
  "openaiBaseUrl": "https://api.together.xyz/v1",
  "openaiModel": "black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell"
}
```

> All three providers support **reference images**. MeiGen and OpenAI-compatible APIs accept URLs directly; ComfyUI accepts both URLs and local file paths, injecting them into LoadImage nodes in your workflow.

---

## Configuration

### Interactive Setup (Recommended)

```
/meigen:setup
```

The wizard walks you through provider selection, API key entry, and ComfyUI workflow import. You can also paste a `curl` command from your API provider's docs — it auto-extracts the key, URL, and model.

### Config File

Configuration is stored at `~/.config/meigen/config.json`. ComfyUI workflows are stored at `~/.config/meigen/workflows/`.

### Environment Variables

Environment variables take priority over the config file.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `MEIGEN_API_TOKEN` | MeiGen platform token |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your API key (any OpenAI-compatible provider) |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | API base URL — change this to use Together AI, Fireworks AI, etc. |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | Model name at your provider (e.g., `gpt-image-1.5`, `flux-schnell`) |
| `COMFYUI_URL` | ComfyUI server URL (default: `http://localhost:8188`) |

## Privacy

MeiGen MCP respects your privacy. Here's what happens with your data:

- **ComfyUI (local)** — All processing stays on your machine. No data is sent externally.
- **MeiGen Cloud** — Prompts and reference images are sent to `api.meigen.ai` for generation. Generated images are stored temporarily on Cloudflare R2. See [meigen.ai/privacy](https://www.meigen.ai/privacy).
- **OpenAI-compatible** — Prompts and reference images are sent to the configured API endpoint. See your provider's privacy policy.
- **Reference image upload** — Images are compressed locally (max 2MB) and uploaded to Cloudflare R2 via `gen.meigen.ai`. Uploaded images expire automatically after **24 hours**. No authentication required. ComfyUI users can skip uploading entirely by passing local file paths directly.
- **Gallery search & prompt enhancement** — Run locally against bundled data. No external API calls.

No telemetry, analytics, or tracking of any kind.

### Custom Storage Backend

If you prefer to use your own S3/R2 bucket for reference image uploads, set the `UPLOAD_GATEWAY_URL` environment variable or `uploadGatewayUrl` in `~/.config/meigen/config.json` to point to your own presign endpoint. The endpoint must implement:

```
POST /upload/presign
Content-Type: application/json

Request:  { "filename": "photo.jpg", "contentType": "image/jpeg", "size": 123456 }
Response: { "success": true, "presignedUrl": "https://...", "publicUrl": "https://..." }
```

The `presignedUrl` is used for a `PUT` upload, and `publicUrl` is the publicly accessible URL returned to the user.
